The row count is a bit misleading as simply refactoring have caused addition and removal
of several hundred rows, and we performed most of the refactoring very late. A more, to us,
accurate row count is in commit 3b385d7.

We feel that this is more accurate and neither of us think anyone deserves a failing
grade because of lack of rows (as we found the row count to be inaccurate anyway).
